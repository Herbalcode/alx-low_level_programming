Singly linked list allow storing of data in the memory dynamically with the help of malloc function and using pointer to link each node together.

Singly linked list is different from array in the method storing data, array store date in a contiguous memory location but linked list is dynamic.

linked list is more preferable than array because of it efficiency memory usage.
